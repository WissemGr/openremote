# OpenRemote Full Deployment Strategies

Since Vercel cannot host the complete OpenRemote platform (Java backend + database), here are the recommended deployment approaches:

## Option 1: Hybrid Deployment (Recommended)

### Frontend on Vercel
- Deploy UI applications (manager, insights) on Vercel
- Fast, global CDN distribution
- Automatic deployments from Git

### Backend on Cloud Platform
Choose one of these for the backend services:

#### Railway.app
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

#### Render.com
- Supports Docker deployments
- Built-in PostgreSQL
- Automatic scaling

#### DigitalOcean App Platform
- Docker support
- Managed databases
- Auto-scaling

#### AWS/GCP/Azure
- Full control over infrastructure
- Kubernetes deployment possible
- Use existing docker-compose.yml

## Option 2: All-in-One Platform Deployment

### Railway.app (Easiest)
- Supports Docker Compose
- Built-in PostgreSQL
- Automatic HTTPS
- GitHub integration

### Render.com
- Docker support
- Managed PostgreSQL
- Multiple services support

### Fly.io
- Excellent Docker support
- Global deployment
- Built-in load balancing

## Option 3: Serverless/Edge Functions Approach

### Convert Java Services to Node.js
- Rewrite core services as Vercel Edge Functions
- Use Vercel Postgres (Neon)
- Deploy Keycloak separately

## Option 4: Containerized Deployment

### Docker Compose on VPS
- Use existing docker-compose.yml
- Deploy on DigitalOcean Droplet, Linode, or Hetzner
- Set up reverse proxy with Nginx

### Kubernetes
- Use existing Kubernetes configurations
- Deploy on managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS)

## Recommended Approach: Railway.app

Railway.app is the closest to "deploy everything" experience:

1. Supports your existing Docker setup
2. Built-in PostgreSQL
3. Automatic HTTPS and domains
4. GitHub integration
5. Environment variables management

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare for Railway Deployment
```bash
# Create railway.toml
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration
- Set up environment variables
- Configure database connections
- Set up domain routing

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
railway up
```

## Cost Comparison

| Platform | Free Tier | Paid Plans | Best For |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Railway | $5 credit | $20+/month | Full-stack apps |
| Render | Free tier | $7+/month | Docker apps |
| Vercel | Generous free | $20+/month | Frontend only |
| DigitalOcean | N/A | $5+/month | VPS deployment |
